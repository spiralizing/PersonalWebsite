During my PhD and postdoctoral years I worked doing research related to **music** from a **Statistical Physics** and **Complex Systems** perspective. 

**Music** is a **cultural phenomena** that emerges from social and cultural interactions with individual and collective implications. It’s multi-scale and multi-factorial characteristics makes music a very appealing subject of study to understand problems related not only to socio-cultural behavior and evolution but also to cognitive processes such as **creativity** or **innovation**.

For this reason, identifying, quantifying and characterizing musical features is essential to explore more complicated aspects like cultural evolution or innovation.

## Scaling and Nonlinearity in music scores
The **auto-correlation** function of a signal contains information about its structural properties. The **scaling behavior** of the auto-correlation function has been related to _pleasantness_ in music ($1/f$ noise) in previous studies. Here we show that there are different types of scaling behavior in music that were not documented before: **two scaling regions** and **no clear scaling**, we also show that having scale invariance ($1/f$ noise) is not enough for music to be considered pleasant, finding that **nonlinear features** could play an important role in **music enjoyment**.

## Musical narrative and the arrow of time in western classical music

**Musical narrative** -the sensation that music has a direction to go- generates **expectation**, however musicologists argue that for music to be pleasant it should have a **balance between expectation and surprise**. In this work we quantify **irreversibility** -the directionality- in melodies and relate it with **interval asymmetry**, finding a clear correlation between both quantities. We found that irreversibility is a **universal property** in music and is also related to nonlinear features that could be relevant to music enjoyment.

## Music innovation and evolution of harmony in western classical music

Creativity and **innovation** are concepts difficult to define and quantify. Music offers a way to indirectly measure features related to innovation. Using a **local key representation** in musical pieces we quantify innovation in **key transitions** over 500 years. This framework allows also to quantify properties related to key diversity and key uncertainty, the latter one closely related to **tonal tension** and **harmonic complexity**. We identify trends in history as well as in personal development within specific composers.

## Frequency-dependent selection in music listenings

Can we identify **evolutionary signatures** in social and **cultural behavior**? Can we understand underlying mechanisms when choosing what music to listen to, within the framework of evolutionary theory? – here we use evolutionary theory concepts to identify and measure **frequency-dependent selection** in listening histories.
