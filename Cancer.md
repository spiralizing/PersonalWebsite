During my postdoctoral stay at the [Computational Genomics Lab](http://csbig.inmegen.gob.mx/) from the [National Institute of Genomic Medicine](https://www.inmegen.gob.mx/) in MÃ©xico City, I worked on developing a hybrid data-driven **clustering** algorithm that combines **eigenvalue decomposition** and **$k$-medoids** to find communities of **genes** with **statistically dependent expression** inside each chromosome. We found that the **statistical dependency** in groups is related to their **physical distance** in the chromosome and this effect is correlated to the **malignancy** of the cancer type. This result confirms previous studies of loss of long-range correlation in gene co-expression and contributes to the understanding of this effect in the intra-chromosome scale.
