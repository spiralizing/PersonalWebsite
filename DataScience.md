Most of my research is data-oriented and requires a great deal of coding. Learning about inference methods and statistical analysis made me become more interested in **_data science_** and **_machine learning_**. Here you can find small projects, exercises or examples of analysis that I have done during my exploration of tools and data that I found interesting enough to learn. 

Some of the entries are more technical than others, but all of them have their respective notebooks where you can check the original source of the code. The subjects of the entries are diverse, from **time series analysis** to **computer simulations** or **classification** and **regression**. 

I hope you find something useful or interesting.
