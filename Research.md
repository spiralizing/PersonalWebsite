My path in research has not been straightforward, since college I have been interested in diverse and **interdisciplinary** subjects so I have switched between fields more than once. **Chemistry** was the science where I felt the most comfortable during highschool so I decided to study that in my Bachelor, later on, during my third year I realized that every topic I found interesting was related to theoretical chemistry or **physical chemistry** to be more specific. I decided to switch to Physics for my master and PhD, where I found all the beauty of applied math (dynamical systems) and fell in love with **statistical physics** and complex systems and their potential to study almost any type of system. The **complex systems** framework allowed me to explore questions I never thought I would be able to, and it allowed me to work in studying one of my other all-time passions: **Music**.

Here you can find scientific research projects I have worked -and currently work- on.
